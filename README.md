Tuil is a template that helps to get you started with React Native using TypeScript, ESLiint, Jest & Styled Components.

**Note this template supports react-native ^0.60.0 and react-native-cli ^2.0.0, because of breaking changes in the custom template mechanism.**

```bash
npx react-native init MyApp --template=tuil
```

This will create a react-native project for iOS and Android. Code Quality ensurance is based on eslint config, pre-commit/push hooks, editorconfig, .nvmrc, .yarnrc, jest & typescript. It creates a ./src folder which contains the react-native code in a domain like structure.

## Features

* Based on the official React Native template
* Use the latest dependencies!
* Ready to go with TypeScript, Testing and Styled Components!
* Nice domain based folder structure

## Moving parts
- The editorconfig is located in .editorconfig
